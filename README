$Id$

Read the INSTALL file, manual page and source code for more information.

iftop must be run as root.

BUILDING

Typically you would run `autoreconf -i', `./configure' and then `make'.

KNOWN ISSUES

RedHat 7.2:

There is a bug in the version of ncurses distibuted with RedHat 7.2 that
will cause iftop to segfault.  The RPM in RedHat's Rawhide distribution
fixes this.

Slackware 8.1:

You may need to upgrade your libpcap (by updating the tcpdump package) 
in order to compile iftop.

FreeBSD 4.7:

This version of FreeBSD lacks a proper gethostbyaddr_r function. You should
choose an alternative name resolution technique using the --with-resolver=...
option to configure.

Solaris:

On Solaris, iftop has to run in promiscuous mode in order to capture
outgoing packets.  iftop autoconfigures to run in promiscuous mode on
Solaris, but will filter out non-broadcast packets which are not
addressed to or from localhost.  On Solaris, the -p option merely
disables that filter.

If you have some other sort of system that behaves like Solaris in
needing promiscuous mode, you can pass --enable-default-promiscuous to
configure to enable this behavior.

Cf. http://www.tcpdump.org/lists/workers/2002/02/msg00010.html

The version of curses distributed with Solaris may not be sufficient for
iftop's needs. You will probably need ncurses or similar.
